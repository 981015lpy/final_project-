# final_project-
My project is a word game, through the P5. JS front-end framework and JavaScript for overall game development

Run games locally

1. Put the game in nodejs or nginx Apache server environment



http://127.0.0.1 :8080/ index.html



matters needing attention

In order to avoid direct access to the game on the local server



Overall game logic design

1. Start interface

Enter the game by clicking the start button

2. Select character interface

Three characters are set in the game. The player enters the next scene after selecting the characters

3. Game backbone design

The game through the mode of answering questions, a question into the next level, wrong answer into the end of the game screen, from a new start, all three questions are answered correctly and successfully
